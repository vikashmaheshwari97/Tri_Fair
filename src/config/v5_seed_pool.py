"""Shared, diverse initial instruction pool for the Tri-Fair v5 study.

The pool is deliberately shared by Tri-Fair-v5 and NSGA-II-PO-Fair.  It improves
coverage of qualitatively different decision procedures without giving either
optimizer privileged starting information.  Tri-Fair-v5's method-specific smart
warm start is implemented inside the optimizer and consumes the ordinary 5M
search budget.
